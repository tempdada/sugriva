          <p class="mid-font">A computer is an electronic machine which can be used to solve a problem or
            perform a certain function according to the instructions given to it. Today computers are used
            almost everywhere. Computer education is the process of learning about or teaching about the
            computers. It includes the basic knowledge of computer system, skills, ideas, and the basic
            terminologies related to the computer system. It also includes the advantages and disadvantages
            of computers, the potential of a computer system, how a computer can be used to solve different
            problems of day to day life or how can a computer be programmed to solve the extreme problem.
            Computer education has become an integral part of the twenty-first century. It has gained a lot
            of importance in todayâ€™s life. Today, computers are used in almost every field. Therefore, it
            has become necessary to learn about computers.</p>

      <p class="second-sec-subtag small-font">Computer is an electronic machine that takes an input, processes it
        to producethe desired output. Every computer is a combination of hardware and software.The physical
        components of a computer that can be seen and touched form thehardware. For example, CPU, monitor,
        keyboard, printer etc., are hardware orperipheral devices. The input to a computer is given in the form
        of instructions.These set of instructions that we give to the computer to perform a particular
        taskconstitutes a program. Many such programs together form a software for thecomputer. Operating
        system, Antivirus, MS Office, Computer games are allsoftware applications.Computer is an advanced
        electronic device that takes raw data as an input from the user and processes it under the control of a
        set of instructions (called program), produces a result (output), and saves it for future use.

      <p class="second-sec-subtag small-font">The hardware component is characterized by the use of electronic
        devices, configured in an integral system, where the variables present in the march are recorded; the
        mechanism used is based on a circuit based on inertial navigation, the variables presented in the march
        are registered by means of a data acquisition card, where digital inputs are used; for this purpose the
        acquisition card used is configured to acquire the signal and sent it to the computer via wireless
        transmission; for this purpose a Bluetooth device is used, having the variables of the march in the
        computer; the signal is configured so that it performs the movements in the game designed in Minecraft,
        simulating a keyboard or mouse; that way it achieves the interaction between the game and the movements
        of the human body.</p>

      <p class="second-sec-tag big-font">Cyber Security</p>
      <p class="second-sec-subtag small-font">Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting critical systems and
        sensitive information from digital attacks. Also known as information technology (IT) security,
        cybersecurity measures are designed to combat threats against networked systems and applications,
        whether those threats originate from inside or outside of an organization.



        Security system complexity, created by disparate technologies and a lack of in-house expertise, can
        amplify these costs. But organizations with a comprehensive cybersecurity strategy, governed by best
        practices and automated using advanced analytics, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, can
        fight cyberthreats more effectively and reduce the lifecycle and impact of breaches when they occur.</p>

      <p class="second-sec-tag big-font">Ethical Hacking</p>
      <p class="second-sec-subtag small-font">Ethical hacking is also known as White hat Hacking or Penetration
        Testing. Ethical hacking involves an authorized attempt to gain unauthorized access to a computer system
        or data. Ethical hacking is used to improve the security of the systems and networks by fixing the
        vulnerability found while testing.

        Ethical hackers improve the security posture of an organization. Ethical hackers use the same tools,
        tricks, and techniques that malicious hackers used, but with the permission of the authorized person.
        The purpose of ethical hacking is to improve the security and to defend the systems from attacks by
        malicious users.</p>
